# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.  The example highlights the unexpected behavior and proposes a solution.

## Problem

The `$in` operator is typically used to check if a field's value is present in a given array. However, when the array includes `null`, the query may not produce the intended results.  `null` values in MongoDB are distinct from empty strings or 0, and can lead to unexpected behavior in queries.

## Solution

The solution shows how to handle null values properly to get accurate results from the MongoDB query. This can involve checking for null separately or filtering the array to exclude nulls before performing the `$in` operation.  More efficient queries can be constructed by considering different query structures, depending on the specific query requirement.
